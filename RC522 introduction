What is RC522?
The MFRC522 is a highly integrated reader/writer IC for contactless communication
at 13.56 MHz. The MFRC522 reader supports ISO/IEC 14443 A/MIFARE and NTAG.
The MFRC522â€™s internal transmitter is able to drive a reader/writer antenna designed to
communicate with ISO/IEC 14443 A/MIFARE cards and transponders without additional
active circuitry. The receiver module provides a robust and efficient implementation for
demodulating and decoding signals from ISO/IEC 14443 A/MIFARE compatible cards and
transponders. The digital module manages the complete ISO/IEC 14443 A framing and
error detection (parity and CRC) functionality.
The MFRC522 supports MF1xxS20, MF1xxS70 and MF1xxS50 products. The MFRC522
supports contactless communication and uses MIFARE higher transfer speeds up to
848 kBd in both directions.
